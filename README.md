# RNA-seq-Analysis-Methods-Comparison
Code for comparing different RNA-seq differential analysis methods in R/Bioconductor

The codes are used for comparing the performance of eight methods used in RNA-seq data analysis (edgeR, DESeq, DESeq2, baySeq, EBSeq, NOISeq, SAMSeq, Voom) across different scenarios with either equal or unequal library sizes.

The codes for comparison using RNA-seq count data from the two most commonly-used inbred mouse strains in neuroscience research - C57BL/6J(B6) and DBA/2J(D2) are also included.
